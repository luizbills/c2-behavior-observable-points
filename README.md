# Observable Points

A *Construct 2 behavior* that stores *float* values and trigger events when they changes.

Very useful for implementing *Hit Points*, *Magic Points*, *Movement Speed* and other *numbers* that changes with frequency in games.

> Note: *A object can have more than 1 Observable Points*.

## How to install

Download the [latest version of the behavior](https://github.com/luizbills/c2-behavior-observable-points/releases/download/v0.1/observablepoints-0.1.c2addon), then drag and drop the `.c2addon` file in to your Construct 2 window. Construct 2 will prompt to ask if you want to install the behavior. If you approve the install, you must restart Construct 2 before the behavior becomes available.

## Documentation

Read the [documentation](https://github.com/luizbills/c2-behavior-observable-points/blob/master/docs/documentation.md) or clone this repository and open *our project used for tests* inside of folder `test` (you must install the addon first).
